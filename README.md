ChatGPT App Review Analysis
This project analyzes over 196,000 user reviews of the ChatGPT mobile application to understand user satisfaction, identify key feedback themes, and provide actionable insights.

Project Objective
The goal is to perform a comprehensive analysis of textual review data to:

Understand the general sentiment users express about ChatGPT.

Identify the specific features or aspects that users most frequently praise or criticize.

Translate these findings into recommendations for product and development teams.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is chatgpt_reviews.csv, which contains user reviews, ratings, and the date of the review.

Key Findings
The analysis reveals a highly positive user sentiment, with the vast majority of users giving the app a 5-star rating.

Positive Feedback Themes
Users who rate the app highly consistently praise its utility and ease of use. The most frequently mentioned positive terms are:

helpful

easy

work

information

answers

This indicates that users see ChatGPT as a valuable tool for productivity and learning.

Negative Feedback Themes
User frustration is primarily linked to technical issues rather than the quality of the AI. The most common words in negative reviews are:

working

open

time

please

fix

This suggests that bugs, slow performance, and issues with the app not opening are the main pain points for dissatisfied users.

Recommendations
For the Development Team: Prioritize app stability and performance. Focusing on fixing bugs and improving load times will address the main sources of user dissatisfaction.

For the Product Team: Continue to market the app's strengths as a helpful and easy-to-use tool for work, study, and finding information.
